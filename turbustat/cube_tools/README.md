Tools for manipulating cubes
============================

To-Dos
------
-   add noise to simulated cubes using signal-id
-   trim empty channels off cubes
-   manipulate spectral axes to match
-   create Simulation and Observation classes to ensure proper treatment of the two types
-   options for on-the-fly data reduction
-   option to shift spectral axes (testing measure between two simulated cubes)
