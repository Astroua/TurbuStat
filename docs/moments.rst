Deriving Cube Moments
=====================

The `~turbustat.moments.Moments` class returns moment arrays as well as their errors for use with 2D statistics in the package. Moments are derived using `spectral-cube <https://github.com/radio-astro-tools/spectral-cube>`_. Definitions for the moments are also available in the `spectral-cube documentation <https://spectral-cube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/spectral_cube.SpectralCube.html#spectral_cube.SpectralCube.moment>`_.

Basic Use
---------

Moments are easily returned in the expected form for the statistics with `~turbustat.moments.Moments`. This class takes a FITS file of a spectral-line cube as input and creates moment arrays (zeroth, first, and line width) with their respective uncertainties.::

    >>> from turbustat.moments import Mask_and_Moments  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> # Load in the cube "test.fits"
    >>> mm = Moments("test.fits")  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> mm.make_moments()  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> mm.make_moment_errors()  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> output_dict = mm.to_dict()  # doctest: +SKIP

`output_dict` is a dictionary that contains keys for the cube and moments. The moment keys contain a list of the moment and its error map.

The moments can also be saved to FITS files. The `~turbustat.moments.Moments.to_fits` function saves FITS files of each moment. The input to the function is the prefix to use in the filenames::

    >>> mm.to_fits("test")  # doctest: +SKIP

This will produce three FITS files: `test_moment0.fits`, `test_centroid.fits`, `test_linewidth.fits` for the zeroth, first, and square-root of the second moments, respectively. These FITS files will contain two extensions, the first with the moment map and the second with the uncertainty map for that moment.
