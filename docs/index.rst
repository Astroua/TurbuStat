TurbuStat
=========

TurbuStat implements a 14 turbulence-based statistics described in the astronomical literature. TurbuStat also defines a distance metrics for each statistic to quantitatively compare spectral-line data cubes, as well as column density, integrated intensity, or other moment maps.
