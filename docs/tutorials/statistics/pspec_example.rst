Spatial Power Spectrum
**********************

Overview
--------

A common analysis technique for two-dimensional images is the spatial power spectrum -- the square of the 2D Fourier transform of an image. A radial profile of the 2D power spectrum gives the 1D power spectrum. The slope of this 1D spectrum can be compared to the expected indices in different physical limits. For example, the velocity field of Kolmogorov turbulence follows :math:`k^{-5/3}`, while Burgers' turbulence has :math:`k^{-2}`.

However, observations are a combination of both velocity and density fluctuations (e.g., `Lazarian & Pogosyan 2000 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2000ApJ...537..720L/abstract>`_), and the measured index from an integrated intensity map depend on both components, as well as optical depth effects. For a turbulent optically thin tracer, an integrated intensity image (or zeroth moment) will have :math:`k^{-11/3}`, while an optically thick tracer saturates to :math:`k^{-3}` (`Lazarian & Pogosyan 2004 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2004ApJ...616..943L/abstract>`_, `Burkhart et al. 2013 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2013ApJ...771..123B/abstract>`_). The effect of velocity resolution is discussed in the :ref:`VCA tutorial <vca_tutorial>`.

**The data in this tutorial are available** `here <https://girder.hub.yt/#user/57b31aee7b6f080001528c6d/folder/59721a30cc387500017dbe37>`_.

We need to import the `~turbustat.statistics.PowerSpectrum` code, along with a few other common packages:

    >>> from turbustat.statistics import PowerSpectrum
    >>> from astropy.io import fits

And we load in the data:

    >>> moment0 = fits.open("Design4_flatrho_0021_00_radmc_moment0.fits")[0]  # doctest: +SKIP

The power spectrum is computed using:

    >>> pspec = PowerSpectrum(moment0, distance=250 * u.pc)  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> pspec.run(verbose=True, xunit=u.pix**-1)  # doctest: +SKIP

The code returns a summary of the one-dimensional fit and a figure showing the one-dimensional spectrum and model on the left, and the two-dimensional power-spectrum on the right. If `fit_2D=True` is set in `~turbustat.statistics.PowerSpectrum.run` (the default setting), the contours on the two-dimensional power-spectrum are fit using an elliptical power-law model. We will discuss the models in more detail below. The dashed red lines (or contours) on both plots are the limits of the data used in the fits.

The power spectrum of this simulation has a slope of :math:`-3.3\pm0.1`, but the power-spectrum deviates from a single power-law on small scales. This is due to the the :ref:`limited inertial range in this simulation <data_for_tutorial>`. The spatial frequencies used in the fit can be limited by setting `low_cut` and `high_cut`. The inputs should have frequency units in pixels, angle, or physical units. For example,

    >>> pspec.run(verbose=True, xunit=u.pix**-1, low_cut=0.025 / u.pix,
    ...           high_cut=0.1 / u.pix)  # doctest: +SKIP

When limiting the fit to the inertial range, the slope is :math:`-3.0\pm0.2`. `low_cut` and `high_cut` can also be given as spatial frequencies in angular units (e.g., `u.deg**-1`). And since a distance was specified, the `low_cut` and `high_cut` can also be given in physical frequency units (e.g., `u.pc**-1`).

The fit to the two-dimensional power-spectrum has also changed. These parameters aren't included in the fit summary for the 1D fit. Instead, they can be accessed through:

    >>> print(pspec.slope2D, pspec.slope2D_err)  # doctest: +SKIP
    (-3.155235947194412, 0.19744198375014044)

    (1.1364954648370515, 0.09436799399259721)

.. this description of bootstrapping doesn't make sense to me.  Are you really adding the residuals to the input data?  I think you're actually adding resampled residuals (randomized residuals) to the *model*, based on what I read in `TurbuStat.fitting_utils.residual_bootstrap`.  Maybe I'm wrong, though, since I don't know what 'wendog' is.

The slope is moderately steeper than in the 1D model, but within the respective uncertainty ranges. By default, the parameter uncertainties for the 2D model are determined by a bootstrap. After fitting the model, the residuals are added back to the data, and re-fit some number of times (the default is 100). The bootstrap estimation is enabled by the `bootstrap` keyword in `~turbustat.statistics.PowerSpectrum.fit_2Dpspec` and the number of iterations is set with `niters` (the default is 100). These can be set in `~turbustat.statistics.PowerSpectrum.run` by passing a keyword dictionary to `fit_2D_kwargs` (e.g., `fit_2D_kwargs={'bootstrap': False}`). The other parameters are the ellipticity, which is bounded between 0 and 1 (with 1 being circular), and theta, the angle between the x-axis and the semi-major axis of the ellipse. Theta is bounded between 0 and :math:`\pi`. The 2D power spectrum here is moderately anisotropic.


Breaks in the power-law behaviour in observations (and higher-resolution simulations) can result from differences in the physical processes dominating at those scales (e.g., `Swift & Welch 2008 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2008ApJS..174..202S/abstract>`_). To capture this behaviour, `PowerSpectrum` can be passed a break point to enable fitting with a segmented linear model (`~turbustat.statistics.Lm_Seg`):

    >>> pspec.run(verbose=True, xunit=u.pc**-1, low_cut=0.02 / u.pix, high_cut=0.4 / u.pix,
    ...           fit_kwargs={'brk': 0.1 / u.pix, 'log_break': False}, fit_2D=False)  # doctest: +SKIP

`brk` is the initial guess fpr where the break point location is. Here I've set it to the extent of the inertial range of the simulation. `log_break` should be enabled if the given `brk` is already the log (base-10) value (since the fitting is done in log-space). The segmented linear model iteratively optimizes the location of the break point, trying to minimize the gap between the different components. This is the `x3` parameter above. The slopes of the components are `x1` and `x2`, but the second slope is defined *relative to the first slope* (i.e., if `x2=0`, the slopes of the components would be the same). The true slopes can be accessed through `pspec.slope` and `pspec.slope_err`. The location of the fitted break point is given by `pspec.brk`, and its uncertainty `pspec.brk_err`. If the fit does not find a good break point, it will revert to a linear fit without the break.

Note that the 2D fitting was disabled in this last example. The 2D model cannot fit a break point, and will instead try to fit a single power-law for the between `low_cut` and `high_cut`, which we know already know is the wrong model. Thus, it has been disabled to avoid confusion. A strategy for fitting the 2D model when the spectrum shows a break is to first fit the 1D model, find the break point, and then fit the 2D spectrum independently using the break point as the `high_cut` in `~turbustat.statistics.PowerSpectrum.fit_2Dpspec`.

There may be cases where you want to limit the azimuthal angles used to create the 1D averaged power-spectrum. This may be useful if, for example, you want to find a measure of anistropy but the 2D power-law fit is not performing well. We will add extra constraints to the previous example with a break point:

The azimuthal mask has been added onto the plot of the two-dimensional power spectrum. The constraints used here are based on the major axis direction from the two-dimensional fit performed above. This is given as `theta_0`. The other parameter, `delta_theta`, is the width of the azimuthal mask to use. Both parameters can be specified in any angular unit.

The default fit uses Ordinary Least Squares. A Weighted Least Squares can be enabled with `weighted_fit=True` *if* the segmented linear fit is not used:

The fit has not changed significantly but may in certain cases.


If strong emission continues to the edge of the map (and the map does not have periodic boundaries), ringing in the FFT can introduce a cross pattern in the 2D power-spectrum. This effect and the use of apodizing kernels to taper the data is covered :ref:`here <apodkerns>`.

Most observational data will be smoothed over the beam size, which will steepen the power spectrum on small scales.  To account for this, the 2D power spectrum can be divided by the beam response. This is demonstrated :ref:`here <correcting_for_beam>` for spatial power-spectra.
