Data for tutorials
******************

Two data sets are used for the tutorials and can be downloaded `here <https://girder.hub.yt/#user/57b31aee7b6f080001528c6d/folder/59721a30cc387500017dbe37>`_. The data are synthetic :math:`^{13}{\rm CO}(2\rightarrow)1` spectral-line data cubes from different ENZO adaptive-mesh-refinement simulations.  The simulations setup and input parameters are given in `Koch et al. 2017 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017MNRAS.471.1506K/abstract>`_ (see Table 1). One of the data sets is a "Fiducial" and the other is a "Design" simulation; the input parameters for the solenoidal fraction, virial parameter, plasma beta, Mach number, and driving scale all differ between the two simulations.

+---------------------+----------+--------+
| Parameter           | Fiducial | Design |
+=====================+==========+========+
| Solenoidal Fraction |    1/2   |  1/3   |
+---------------------+----------+--------+
| Virial Parameter    |     6    |   2    |
+---------------------+----------+--------+
| Plasma beta         |     1    |   2    |
+---------------------+----------+--------+
| Mach number         |    8.5   |   5    |
+---------------------+----------+--------+
| Driving scale       |    2-8   |  2-4   |

The simulations were performed on a :math:`128^3` base grid with a fixed random turbulent driving field and the boundaries are continuous (i.e., periodic box). The data cubes were produced from one time step after gravity is turned one (:math:`\sim0.1` of the free-fall time). The spectral resolution (i.e., channel width) of the cubes is :math:`40` m/s.

Moment maps can also be downloaded from the data cubes with the link above. Each data cube has a zeroth (integrated intensity), first (centroid), and square of the second (line width) moment maps.

These data have a limited inertial range, which is evident in the :ref:`Spatial Power Spectrum tutorial <pspec_tutorial>`. Turbulent dissipation causes the power-spectrum to steepen on small scales and it is necessary to limit the range of scales that are fit.
