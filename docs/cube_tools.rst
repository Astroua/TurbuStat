**THESE ROUTINES ARE UNTESTED AND STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. THEY WILL BE INCORPORATED IN A FUTURE RELEASE.**

This module provides classes to handle observational and simulated data. They are not complete and should not be used in their current form.

Once finished, each class will handle all of the pre-processing necessary for facilitating proper comparisons. For simulated data, this will include adding in realistic observational noise. For observational data, robust noise estimation will be completed using `signal_id <https://github.com/radio-astro-tools/signal-id>`_. Simple noise removal techniques may also become available.
